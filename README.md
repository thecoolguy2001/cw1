## Core objective: Develop a Flutter application that accomplishes both Task 1 and Task 2.
Task 1: Counter Button
Requirements:
• Display the initial counter value (e.g., 0) on the screen.
• Include a button labelled "Increment."
• Increase the counter by one when the button is pressed.
Guidelines:
• Initiate a new Flutter project.
• Design the user interface using a Text widget to showcase the counter
value and a button for the increment button.
• Employ a variable to keep track of the counter value.
• Implement the onPressed event handler for the button to increment the
counter.

Task 2: Image Toggle
Objective: app that toggles between two images when a button is pressed.
Requirements:
• Display an initial image on the screen.
• Include a button labelled "Toggle Image."
• Change the displayed image to another image when the button is
pressed.
Guidelines:
• Integrate this functionality into the same screen as the counter button.
• Design the user interface using an Image widget to exhibit the image and
a RaisedButton or ElevatedButton for the toggle button.
• Utilize a boolean variable to track the current image state.
• Implement the onPressed event handler for the button to toggle
between the two images.

Objective: Add functionality to reset the counter and image back to their
initial states.
Requirements:
• Display a third button labeled "Reset."
• When pressed, the counter should reset to 0 and the image should
revert to the initial image.
Guidelines:
• Integrate this feature on the same screen alongside the counter and
image toggle buttons.
• Use the onPressed event handler for the reset button to reset the
counter variable and toggle the image back to its original state.
